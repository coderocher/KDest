This is my first front-end developed hero page.
Topic: Tourist spots of Karnataka
Concepts used: html, css, javascript
Description: Though non-functional, working on this project helped me rebuild my fundamentals of html, css and js.
I built this webpage after designing a raw page, trimming out the non-core/ additional content, and tried to make it much user-friendly as possible.
Referred tailblocks for parts of header and footer.
